# My WebGL Repository

This repository will contain several projects created by me with the purpose of practicing WebGL programming. Maybe there will be some of my notes as well.

* Homework 2 is using transformation matrixes to draw a simple solar system. The project is contained in `\CG_HW_2`
* Homework 3 is using `glFructum` in place of `glPerspective` . The project is contained in `\CG_HW_3`
* Homework 4 is draw a circle using Rational Bezier curves. The project is contained in `\CG_HW_4`
* Lab 7 is to implement a edge detection algorithm by using the `Sobel` Kernel. The project is contained in `\CG_Lab_7`
